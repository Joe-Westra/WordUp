TODO
    
    Currently the program is parsing the main senses of the word only.  That sucks
    -Categories of each sense of the word must be incorporated into definitions.
    -Pheonetic spelling (is that spelled correctly?!) needs be incorporated as well
    -Major clean up of code needed, it's getting convoluted.

-Create a MySQL database to store the information (using JDBC)
