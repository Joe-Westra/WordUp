The purpose of this is to provide command line access to a dictionary that logs the queries it recieves.
Ideally this will enable the queries to be leveraged to help users commit new words to memory, and therefor expand their vocabulary.

TODO

-Retrieve definition information from the Oxford Site.

(API Schema and relevant information available at https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/documentation 
Look under 'dictionary entries')

    Much work to be done here.
    Currently the program is parsing the main senses of the word only.
    -Categories of each sense of the word must be incorporated into definitions.
    -Pheonetic spelling (is that spelled correctly?!) needs be incorporated as well
    -Major clean up of code needed, it's getting convoluted.

-Create a MySQL database to store the information (using JDBC)
